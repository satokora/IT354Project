# IT354 Spring 2015 Semester Project #

## Project Statement
The outcome of the project is a website that enables users to make their own recipe cards in consistent layout and create their own recipe box. They can not only upload their own recipe, but also search for new recipes from various cooking websites by interacting with a cooking recipe API.  As an additional feature, if a user has already found a recipe on a specific web page, the user can retrieve its ingredient and direction information by simply pasting its URL. This feature will be implemented by using text-scraping technique.
